Libvisual is an abstraction library that comes between applications and
audio visualisation plugins.

Often when it comes to audio visualisation plugins or programs that create
visuals they do depend on a player or something else, basically there is no
general framework that enable application developers to easy access cool
audio visualisation plugins. Libvisual wants to change this by providing
an interface towards plugins and applications, through this easy to use
interface applications can easily access plugins and since the drawing is
done by the application it also enables the developer to draw the visual
anywhere he wants.

Brought in from Fedora 20.
