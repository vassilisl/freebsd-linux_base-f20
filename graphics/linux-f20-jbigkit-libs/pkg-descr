JBIG-KIT provides a portable library of compression and decompression
functions with a documented interface that you can include very easily
into your image or document processing software. In addition, JBIG-KIT
provides ready-to-use compression and decompression programs with a
simple command line interface (similar to the converters found in netpbm).

Brought in from Fedora 20
