Cairo is a 2D graphics library designed to provide high-quality display
and print output. Currently supported output targets include the X Window
System, OpenGL (via glitz), in-memory image buffers, and image files (PDF,
PostScript, and SVG).

Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media while
taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available (e.g.
through the X Render Extension or OpenGL).

Part of Fedora 20.
