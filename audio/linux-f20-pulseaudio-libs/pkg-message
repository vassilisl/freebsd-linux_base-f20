Make sure that pulseaudio works natively on your system before trying to set
this up.

Additional steps
----------------

You need to set PULSE_COOKIE environment variable as

    PULSE_COOKIE=$HOME/.pulse-cookie

or else the Linux client will try to use the cookie at
$HOME/.config/pulse/cookie which is not the one that the FreeBSD server is
checking against.

Also you might want to set the default sink, as an environment variable or
in /compat/linux/etc/pulse/client.conf, so that it matches your system's
configuration. e.g.:

    PULSE_SINK=oss_output.dsp1

Might be a good idea to add these to your shell .rc
