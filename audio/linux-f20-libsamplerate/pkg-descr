Secret Rabbit Code is a sample rate converter for audio. It is capable
of arbitrary and time varying conversions. It can downsample by a
factor of 12 and upsample by the same factor. The ratio of input and
output sample rates can be a real number. The conversion ratio can
also vary with time for speeding up and slowing down effects

Brought in from Fedora 20.
