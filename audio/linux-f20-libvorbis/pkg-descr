Ogg Vorbis is a fully open, non-proprietary, patent- and royalty-free,
general-purpose compressed audio format for audio and music at fixed
and variable bitrates.

The libvorbis package contains runtime libraries for use in programs
that support Ogg Vorbis.

This package brings in the libvorbis libraries from Fedora 20.
