Make sure native OSS works correctly on your system before trying to set
this up.

Additional steps
----------------

Check that /compat/linux/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/50-pcm-oss.conf is set
to use the correct devices (/dev/dspX and /dev/mixerX).

You need to set the default path for ALSA to be used with all your apps, or
else you will have to pass -Doss to your aplay from the command line.
Enter the following in your ~/.asoundrc. Remeber that this will override the
configuration you may have in
/compat/linux/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf.d/99-pulseaudio-default.conf


### Default to OSS ###

pcm.!default {
    type oss
    hint {
        show on
        description "Default ALSA Output (currently Open Sound System)"
    }
}

ctl.!default {
    type oss
}
