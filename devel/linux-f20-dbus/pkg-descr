D-BUS is a system for sending messages between applications. It is
used both for the system-wide message bus service, and as a
per-user-login-session messaging facility.

D-BUS contains some tools that require Xlib to be installed, those are
in this separate package so server systems need not install X.

Brought in from Fedora 20.
